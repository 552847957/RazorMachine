RazorMachine
============

A really easy to use .Net Razor 2 template engine. This implementation supports layouts (masterpages) and a _viewStart construct, just like MVC does support these features. The RazorMachine works independently from MVC. It only needs the System.Web.Razor reference. It almost works exacly like Asp.Net MVC. Take a look at the examples at the wiki to see how easy this framework works.

This RazorMachine comes from the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/423141/Razor-2-0-template-engine-supporting-layouts">CodeProject</a>
