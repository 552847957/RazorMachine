RazorMachine
============

A really easy to use .Net Razor 2 template engine. This implementation supports layouts (masterpages) and a _viewStart construct, just like MVC does support these features. The RazorEngine works independently from MVC. It only needs the System.Web.Razor reference. It almost works exacly like Asp.Net MVC. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/jlamfers/RazorMachine/wiki/Examples" target="_blank">examples at the wiki</a> to see how easy this framework works.
